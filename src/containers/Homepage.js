                  You need to install Metamask¬†<a href="https://metamask.io/" target="_blank"  rel="noreferrer">
                  https://metamask.io/</a>,
                  create a wallet and add funds if necessary. Make sure you are on the main Ethereum network.
                  </Li>
                  <Li><Question>How long should I wait after sending a transaction?</Question>
                  Transactions can take as little as 15 seconds to several minutes depending
                  on the network status.
                  </Li>
                  <Li><Question>Why don&apos;t these tulips look anything like tulips?</Question>
                  CryptoTulip is a minimalist deconstructionist. Its work will be abstract and unique.</Li>
                  <Li><Question>How do I own a tulip artwork?</Question>
                  Tulips are ERC721 tokens. Your ownership is recorded on the main Ethereum network.
                  All the information about your tulip is stored on the blockchain. This site doesn&apos;t
                  have a database!</Li>
                  <Li><Question>What do you mean by &ldquo;no database&rdquo;?</Question>
                  <p>Tulips consist of
                  a foundation tulip reference,
                  an inspiration tulip reference,
                  a block number representing when they were painted,
                  and a 256-byte array representing their shapes & colors.
                  All of this data is stored on the main Ethereum network.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  This site is a simple frontend application, and the only backend is the main Ethereum
                  network, accessed through your Metamask wallet.

                  <Li><Question>How do I acquire a tulip?</Question>
                  For the first hundred tulips, you can design a tulip and claim it for yourself.
                  After that, all new tulips must be painted by CryptoTulip via commissions.
                  </Li>
                  <Li><Question>Are tulip traits combined randomly?</Question>
                  No. The traits of the offspring depend on the foundation, inspiration and the
                  previous blockhashes.
                  It&apos;s possible to predict how a painting will look given the
                  block it will be painted. This is perfectly fine.
                  </Li>
                  <Li><Question>How much does it cost?</Question>
                  Artist&apos;s commission is 1 finney right now (one thousanth of ETH). 
                  After a thousand paintings, artist&apos;s fees  will increase to 1 ETH. 
                  Other operations cost only gas.&nbsp;
                  </Li>
                  <Li><Question>Can we undo anything?</Question>
                  Unfortunately no! It&apos;s important to note that all interactions with
                  CryptoTulip are final.
                  There&apos;s no way to roll back your actions. Please be careful.

                  CryptoTulip is a side project I started just to learn about developing smart contracts.
                  It was a lot of fun to build and I wanted to share it as a sample project for anyone interested.
                  I ended up deploying it on the network and&nbsp;

                  open sourcing
                  </a> the project February 2018. I updated the contract to be ERC721 compliant and released in October 2021.
